# Coursera Dump

The program collects data from N courses in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) and saves the received data to a file

### How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

### How to use
```bash
#Run
$ python3 coursera.py
#Sample output
The program recorded data from 20 random courses on Coursera.org into file filename.xlsx
```
Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.
